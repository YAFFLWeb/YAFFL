      <h1>6-on-6 Adult COED Flag Football Rules
        (Current NFHS rules will apply with these exceptions)        
        </h1>

        <h2>Registration & Fees, Games</h2>
        <p>$40 per season per player. Registration information is always found on the league Facebook Group: YAFFL - COED.  There are 8-10 games in a session, typically, depending on the amount of teams that register.  Sessions are typically in the Spring & Fall each year.  Games are always on Saturdays (mid mornings).  Waivers & state ID are always required.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="rosters">
        <h2>Rosters/Players Shirts/Subs</h2>
        <p>14 players max on rosters.  2 must be women at minimum.  4 men 2 women on the field at all times.  Players must be 17 years of older for COED.  Each team will receive a YAFFL COED shirt for their team colors.  These must be worn during games or a like colored shirt.  Weekly subs are permitted, but must 1) fill out waiver release, 2) pay $5 to YAFFL, and 3) get approval from opposing teams captain & with YAFFL director cc’d. NO SUBS during playoffs.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="field">
        <h2>Field Size/First Downs/Scoring </h2>
        <p>Field sizes can vary but remain smaller, typically 3 first downs.  Ball will start on the 20yd line with 4 downs to gain 20yds.  Scoring is 6pts per touchdown and 1pt (3yds) or 2pt (10yds) conversions are allowed. </p>
      </section>
      <section id="timeouts">
        <h2>Game Length/Timeouts</h2>
        <p>Play will be divided into two 20-minute halves, with a five minute half-time. There will be a running clock maintained by the referee except the FINAL TWO MINUTES OF SECOND HALF the clock is stopped for an incomplete pass, if a player goes out of bounds, if either team scores (clock starts when the opposing team snaps the ball, after the PAT attempt), for a change of possession, if a penalty must be marked off or if a team calls time out. The clock will stop if a first down is reached UNTIL the ball is set. The clock will not stop for a completed pass in bounds.  Each team is allowed two (one-minute) time outs per game.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="equipment">
        <h2>Equipment/Flags/Ball</h2>
        <p>(2) Flag a Tag “Pop Flags” or Shroomz are the only two types permitted.  One flag on each player's hip.  Regulation HS size football must be used.  No pads or padding clothing, except soft headgear.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="open">
        <h2>Open/Gender Play</h2>
        <p>Teams must use a female as an operative player within every three consecutive downs. An open play will be called by the referee if a gender play is not required on the current play. Forced gender plays do not apply to extra points; all extra points are open gender plays.  A female can be used on any play; however when the offense has not used a female/operative player within the last two plays, the next play must be a forced gender play. The operative female player must be used in one of the following three ways to satisfy a female forced gender play:</p> 
        <p>1. As the intended receiver. The ball can be caught behind the line of scrimmage and
          advanced to satisfy a gender play.</p>
          <p>2. As the quarterback: must throw a forward pass across the line of scrimmage or run
            herself. Handing off to a male does not meet gender requirements.</p>
            <p>3. As the running back: cannot immediately throw the ball back to the quarterback to in turn perform a "flea flicker."</p>
            <p>A male can be used on any play; however when the offense has not used a male/operative
              player within the last two plays, the next play must be a forced gender play. The operative male player must be used in one of the following two ways to satisfy a male forced gender play:</p>
              <p>1. As the intended receiver. The ball can be caught behind the line of scrimmage and
                advanced to satisfy a gender play.</p>
                <p>2. As the running back: cannot immediately throw the ball back to the quarterback to in turn perform a "flea flicker."</p>
                <p>Using a male as the quarterback does not meet the gender requirement on male forced gender plays.  If, on a forced gender play, the snap is dropped by a male QB or the male QB intentionally spikes the ball, the play will automatically result in a loss of down and the next play will remain a forced gender play from the spot where the ball hit the ground.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="penalty">
        <h2>Penalty on Gender Play</h2>
        <p>If the foul is on the defensive team, the offense will have 2 options:</p>
        <p>1. Take the ball at the spot of the foul, replay the down (unless the penalty results in a first down) and repeat the gender play.</p>
        <p>2. Decline the penalty; replay the down from the original spot and the next play will be open.
          If the foul is on the offensive player, the 10 yard penalty will be assessed, replay the down and repeat the gender play.
          </p>
      </section>
      <section id="defending">
        <h2>Defending Gender Play</h2>
        <p>Teams can play man to man defense or zone defense. It is recommended, but not required, that males guard males and females guard females.  In no circumstance can a male step in front of, intercept or interfere with a pass thrown to a female, doing so will result in a spot foul. If the pass is intended for a female but is clearly un-catchable by that female (i.e. thrown over her head) or is thrown directly to a male defender, a play may then be made on the ball to knock it down or intercept it. The referee will make the final determination as to whether or not the pass was uncatchable by the female.  If a female is used at quarterback, a defensive female may blitz after the 4 second blitz timer sounds. Male defenders cannot blitz female quarterbacks.  If the play is a forced gender play and the ball is tipped at the line of scrimmage by a defender guarding a male QB, it will be considered interference and a penalty will be assessed. If the play is not a forced gender play and the ball is tipped at the line of scrimmage by a defender it will not be considered interference since the defender would be unaware of the pass being intended for a female.  If it is a forced gender play and a jump ball is thrown into a group of offensive and
          defensive players including at least one female receiver, only a female on the defense can
          intercept or interfere with the jump ball.  If it is not a forced gender play and a jump ball is thrown into a group of offensive and defensive players including at least one female receiver, a male or female on the defense can intercept or interfere with the jump ball since the defender would be unaware of the pass being intended for a female.  The play will be at the discretion of the referee as to whether or not there was a male receiver in the same area of the female receiver when the defender interferes with the pass.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="overtime">
        <h2>Overtime</h2>
        <p>Teams will attempt to score in the same end zone. Each team will have four downs to score from the first down line on the side of the field chosen for overtime. If a team scores, they will have the opportunity to go for one or two on the PAT.  Gender rules still apply every 3 downs.  Only one OT period during the regular season.  Playoffs will have unlimited OT periods.  Interceptions will result in a turnover and may not be returned for any points in overtime. </p>
      </section>
      <section id="complete">
        <h2>Complete/Incomplete Pass</h2>
        <p>A forward pass is completed when caught by any player of the passing team who has at least one foot in-bounds. If opponents catch the pass inbounds simultaneously, the ball belongs to the passing team at the spot of the catch.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="qb">
        <h2>QB Run from Scrimmage</h2>
        <p>The QB cannot run for positive yards until a defensive player blitzes and crosses the line of scrimmage.  If it’s a forced gender play and the QB is a male/female, and he/she is blitzed, the QB cannot cross the line of scrimmage. The QB must elude the blitz and find a way to advance the ball to a member of the opposite sex. If the QB eludes the blitz and crosses the line of scrimmage it will be a penalty.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="punts">
        <h2>Punts</h2>
        <p>The offensive team must declare punts on fourth down. No fake punts are allowed. All punts must be kicked. The kicking team must stay on the line of scrimmage until the ball is punted. The receiving teams may fair catch the ball or advance it. If the ball hits the ground after touching any part of the receiver’s body, it becomes a dead ball.  The snap must go through the legs of the center as normal.</p>
      </section>
        <section id="blocking">
          <h2>Blocking</h2>
          <p>No "blocking" of any kind is allowed at any time during the game.</p>
        </section>
      <section id="turnovers">
        <h2>Turnovers</h2>
        <p>A change of possession can only occur due to downs, a punt, or an interception on a forward
          pass. A fumble is not a turnover (the ball is dead at the spot of the fumble).</p>
      </section>
      <section id="defense">
        <h2>Defense</h2>
        <p>1. Blitzing</p>
        <p>a. Each referee will hold a 3 second timer which will be actuated at the snap of every play and will alarm after the 3 seconds counts to 0. Defensive players may rush/cross the line of scrimmage after the blitz timer sounds. It is the responsibility of the referee to ensure they are positioned on the field in a way that the defensive blitzer can hear the alarm sound and to ensure the timer is triggered at the appropriate time every play when the ball is snapped. Should the blitz timer malfunction during game play, the blitz count will revert back to a five Mississippi count, said aloud (loud and slow enough for line judge to hear), by a member of the defense. (i.e. "One Mississippi, Two Mississippi, and so on) The player that blitzes does not have to be the player that counts aloud as long as the blitzer waits until the three Mississippi count has completed. If the defense
          crosses the line before the 3 second blitz timer sounds or before the five Mississippi count, offsides will be called after the play has been completed. The defense is permitted to blitz on extra point plays.
          </p>
          <p>b. The center and any/all receivers are permitted to line up directly in front of the QB to create a wall in front of the pass rush. However; no contact of any kind is allowed. If doing so, the offense must remain in one spot with both hands at their side until the blitzer(s) have crossed the line of scrimmage.</p>
          <p>c. The defensive blitzer (s) must blitz “around” any offensive players remaining still on the line. No contact of any kind is permitted.</p>
          <p>2. Flag Pulling</p>
          <p>a. Players must have two flags attached to their belt at all times. </p>
          <p>b. Shirts are not required to be tucked in pants but the belt and flags must be worn over top of the shirt/pants at all times. The referee will
            issue a warning if he/she feels the shirt is being used to cover the flags and gain an advantage. Continued issues following a warning will result in a penalty. </p>
          <p>c. The play will be ruled down when a member from the defense pulls at least one flag from the offensive player with the ball. If a flag falls off during general game play, the offensive player will be ruled down if a member of the
            defense pulls the remaining flag or is touched by a defender. </p>
          <p>d. If a defender accidentally grabs an article of clothing other than a flag, the defender must immediately release their hands and make a second attempt at the flags. Holding on to the clothing for an extended amount of time will be a penalty. The referee will make the final determination.</p>
          <p>3. Bump and Run Coverage</p>
          <p>Defenders may not apply any contact to the wide receiver at any time after the ball has     been snapped nor can they prevent them from releasing off the line of scrimmage.</p>
        </section>
      <section id="forfeits">
        <h2>Forfeits</h2>
        <p>All game times will be FORFEIT time, no exceptions. A forfeit will result in a 20pt loss for the forfeiting team. Any team that forfeits 2 or more games in the regular season will be disqualified from the league for the remaining season and will not be eligible to participate in playoffs.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="penalties">
        <h2>Penalties</h2>

        <p>Defensive off-sides (from the line) -- A player is offside when any part of his body or his person is beyond the line of scrimmage before the snap of the ball or before the five second count is over. The offensive team has the option to accept or decline. (5yds)</p>
        <p>Pass Interference (from the line) -- Defender may not use their hands or arms to hang onto or encircle a receiver.

(15 yds)</p>
        <p>Holding -- Defender may not grab and hold any part of the offensive player’s body or clothing while trying to pull flags. If an unsuccessful attempt is made to grab flags the defender must let go immediately and make another attempt at the flags. (5yds)</p>
        <p>llegal Gender Defense - Male defender cannot interfere with a female in a forced gender situation: (from the line) -- The offense can choose to accept the penalty for yardage and the plays remains forced gender, accept the penalty and the play becomes open with no added yardage, or decline the penalty and take the result of the play. (5yds)</p>
        <p>Delay of game (from the line/dead ball) --The offensive team must put the ball into play 25 seconds after the referee has placed the ball ready for play. (5yds)</p>
        <p>Illegal participation (from the line) -- Each team may not have more than 6 players on the field at one time: more than 4 men or 2 women on the field. Penalty will be assessed after discovery. (5yds)</p>
        <p>Illegal cadence (from the line/dead ball) -- If the player calling the cadence does not receive the snap, the play will not stand and the down will be repeated. On a forced gender play, the offense must clearly designate which gender will be receiving the snap (QB must raise their hand). (5yds)</p>
        <p>Offensive offsides (from the line/dead ball) -- When any part of the offensive player's body or his person is beyond the scrimmage line before the ball is snapped. (5yds)</p>

        <p>Offensive Picking (from the line/ if this occurs in a forced gender situation, then gender will be replayed) -- The offensive team may not initiate a pick/block while in motion (action by a player who with/without contact delays or prevents an opponent from reaching a desired position). (5yds)</p>
        <p>Not using an operative player in a forced gender situation (from the line/loss of down) -- The penalty for running 3 consecutive plays without a male/female as an operative player will be loss of down, ball is dead and next play must be a gender play. If a QB is rushed and he/she runs the ball, the penalty will be enforced. (5yds)</p>
        <p>Illegal forward passes (from the line/loss of down) -- The offensive team may make one forward pass from behind the line during each play from scrimmage provided the ball does not cross the line and return behind the line before the pass. The defense can either accept or decline the penalty. (5yds)</p>
        <p>QB illegal forward pass (from the line/loss of down)-- If the QB crosses the line of scrimmage and then throws a forward pass, the defense can either decline the penalty or it will be assessed from the line of scrimmage and loss of down (i.e. if it was first down during the penalty, now it is second down). (5yds)</p>
        <p>Intentionally grounding the ball (from the line/loss of down)-- Will be called when a passer, facing an imminent loss of yardage because of pressure from the defense, throws a forward pass without a realistic chance of completion. EXCEPTION: On an open gender
          play a passer is permitted to stop the clock legally to save time if immediately upon
          receiving the snap he begins a continuous throwing motion and throws the ball directly
          forward into the ground. Doing so will count towards a male play. This does not apply if it
          is forced gender; the forced gender spike rule applies in these instances.</p>
        <p>Illegal Diving / Jumping (spot of foul) -- No player may leave his or her feet in order to gain positive yards. The penalty is assessed here (spot of foul).(5yds)</p>

        <p>Flag Guarding (spot of foul) --No player can use his or her hands or arms to protect their
          flags from being pulled by a defensive player. This rule also applies to a player wearing
          their shirt over top of their flag belt/flags. The penalty will be assessed if it occurs after a warning has been issued.</p>
        <p>Pass interference – Defense - Prohibited conduct shall be when a player physically
          restricts or impedes the opponent in a manner that is visually evident and materially affects the opponent's opportunity to gain position or retain his position to catch the ball.
          If pass interference occurs in the end zone, the ball will be placed on the one yard line. (Spot Foul, Automatic First Down)</p>
        <p>Unsportsmanlike conduct (from the line/ If penalty is on the defense, automatic first down/If penalty is on the offense, 15 yards from the line/ If penalty is after a TD, yardage added to extra point conversion) -- Abusive/insulting language or gesture to another player or referee, as well as taunting opponents or similar theatrics before or after the touchdown. (15yds)</p>
        </section>
      <section id="zero">
        <h2>Zero Tolerance Policy</h2>
        <p>Unsportsmanlike conduct will not be tolerated. Fighting, arguing with the referee, excessive swearing and excessive or repeated personal fouls will be treated as unsportsmanlike conduct. At the referee's discretion any individual(s) cited for unsportsmanlike conduct will be ejected from the game. At the league's direction, a player who has been ejected from a game for unsportsmanlike conduct WILL NOT be eligible to play in any remaining games with his/her team for that weekend.
