        <p>Game time is forfeit time. Your team is required to be properly equipped and, on the field, ready to play when the referee blows the whistle to start the game. Start of games occurs with the lower seeded team calling the coin-toss prior to the flip to decide who gets possession of the ball first.  The winner of the coin-toss will have the option to defer or take the ball at their own 5-yard line.  Direction will automatically switch in the 2nd half.</p>
        <p>The offensive team takes possession of the ball at their 5-yard line and has three plays to cross mid-field (first down). Once a team crosses mid-field, they have three plays to score. If the offense fails to score, the ball changes possession. All drives start from the 5-yard line except interceptions which will be spotted where the player is deflagged.  Penalties that result in a first down will give the offense 3 more plays to achieve mid-field (first down) or if the penalty puts the LOS past mid-field, then 3 plays to score.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="coaches">
        <h2>Coaches and Players</h2>

      <section id="grounding">
        <h2>Intentional Grounding</h2>
          <p>This is defined in flag as the QB throwing the ball away to avoid a sack. Intentional Grounding can occur ANYWHERE behind the LOS. The QB can spike the ball within 1 minute of the 2nd half to stop the clock, but he/she must catch the snap and throw it to the ground immediately. Intentional Grounding is a spot foul and loss of down.</p>
        </section>
      <section id="los">
        <h2>All Offensive Penalties Behind the LOS</h2>
          <p> Will be assessed from the LOS except Flag Guarding which will be assessed from the spot of the foul or 10 yards from the LOS whichever is deemed to be considered the greater loss of yardage.  Flag guarding or holding in the endzone will result in safety.</p>

        <h2>Last Man Rule</h2>
        <p>There is no last man rule, however, if a player(s) or coach(s) leaves the sideline and disrupts the play or the offensive player from scoring, the offensive team may be awarded a touchdown.</p>
        <p>If the last defensive player physically contains the ball carrier (e.g., bear hugs, aggressively holds, pushes the ball carrier out-of-bounds, tackles, attempts to tackle, etc.) without making a clear, legal attempt to pull the ball carrier’s flag, the offensive team will be awarded at least one line-zone-to-gain distance from the spot of foul and an automatic first down.</p>
        <p>Officials have the discretion to award a touchdown if the foul occurred inside the final line-zone-to-gain and they reasonably believe the foul is the only thing that prevented the ball carrier from scoring.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="receiving">
        <h2>Receiving</h2>
        <p>All players are eligible to receive a pass, including the original quarterback, only if the ball has been pitched back or handed off (backwards) behind the line of scrimmage. Players must have at least one foot in bounds when making a catch. Players that run out of bounds during a play cannot be the first player to touch the ball when attempting to make a catch unless the player is forced out of bounds, he/she then must first re-establish his position in bounds before he can touch the ball.  Players must have at least 1 foot inbounds when catching the ball in order for it to ruled a completion.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="dead">
        <h2>Play is Ruled Dead When:</h2>
        <p>The offensive player’s flag is pulled. Ball carrier steps out of bounds, touchdown is scored, the ball carriers’ knee touches the ground, an incomplete pass and/or anytime the ball hits the ground. If a player loses a flag unintentionally, the defense only has to touch the ball carrier with one hand, not pull the flag.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="noflag">
        <h2>No Flags On to Start the Play:</h2>
        <p>This is not a penalty, but a violation that will require the player to be leave the field or find his / her flag before beginning the next play.  If a player does not have his or her flag on before the snap, the play will continue and the result of the play will be the result of the play.  However, a player cannot play more than two plays without his or flag on to start the play.  If this occurs, illegal participation will be called and the offense / defense will be assessed a 5-yard penalty and replay the down. </p>
        <p>*** If a player starts the play without their flag and that player catches the ball, that player will be down at the spot of where the player caught the ball.</p>
        <p>*** If a players flag falls off during the play and the receiver catches the ball, they MUST be touched with one hand after the catch to be considered down</p>

      </section>
      <section id="handoff">
        <h2>Handoff, Pitch or Throwback</h2>
        <p>Teams may handoff, pitch, or throw back the football in the backfield. The player who receives the pitch or handoff (backwards) may throw the ball as long as he is not beyond the line of scrimmage. Unlimited pitching (backwards) behind or beyond the LOS is allowed.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="forward">
        <h2>Forward Pass</h2>
        <p>A forward pass does not have to cross the line of scrimmage to be a legal play. Only one forward pass per down.  A forward pass caught behind the LOS is considered a run play.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="sportsmanship">
        <h2>Sportsmanship / Roughing</h2>
        <p>Trash talking will not be tolerated. The official has the right to determine language that is offensive. (Trash talking is language that may be considered offensive to the official, opposing team, or spectators). The official may eject players from the game for trash talking. If the official witnesses any act of tackling, elbowing, cheap shots, or any other sportsmanlike act, the game will be stopped and the player will be ejected from the game.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="penalties">
        <h2>Penalties</h2>
        <p>Teams can accept any penalty and not the yardage.  Example:  3rd down and 3 yards to go for a first down (mid-field).  The defensive team jumps offside, the offensive team can accept the penalty and decline the yards. Result of the play will be 1st down and mid-field.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="overtime">
        <h2>Overtime</h2>
        <p>A coin flip determines first possession. 1st Overtime – Each team will receive the ball at mid-field and have 3 plays to score unless there is a penalty that dictates additional downs. Each additional overtime the ball will be placed at the 12-yard line with 3 plays to score.  This will continue until there is a winner.  Each team will have 1 timeout per overtime.  After the first overtime, the team that has the ball last, will have the ball to start the next overtime and continue switching this way until there is a winner.  There is no Overtime in pool play games. If a team scores, they must attempt the extra point unless that score is the game winner.  Interceptions can be returned for touchdown or on an extra point attempt.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="champ">
        <h2>Championship Game Overtime Rules (Sudden Death)</h2>
        <p>Overtime will start with a coin-toss. The home team will announce heads or tails prior to the flip of the coin. Full game clock will be used (two 12-minute halves). Teams will start on their own 5-yard line unless an interception is thrown. The spot will then be where the player is deflagged during the interception. Each team will receive at least one possession. If the score is tied after each team has received a possession, then the next team that scores wins. Interceptions can be returned.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="attire">
        <h2>Attire</h2>
        <p>Players may not have pockets and may not tape pockets in any way. Only professionally sewn or zippers are fine.</p>

        <p>Only Sonic Flags are allowed and may not be altered in any way. Flags that are cut due to local league policies are prohibited.</p>
        <p>Same color shirts are mandatory – you do not need numbers or matching logos, you only need the same color shirt.</p>
        <p>Referees reserve the right to negate touchdowns or remove players from the game if they are not following our uniform rules.</p>
      </section>
