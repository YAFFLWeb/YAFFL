Players may use their body to assist in stopping the momentum of an offensive player. However, in this motion, the defensive player MUST come up with the offensive player’s flag, if they do not, it will be called unnecessary roughness, 15-yard penalty. It comes to attempting to sack the quarterback, the rusher MUST come up with the flags if they body up, if they don’t get the flags, it is roughing the passer, 15-yard penalty, and an automatic first down.</p>
